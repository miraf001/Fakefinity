üñ•Ô∏è Bezel-compensated DXGI screen mirroring tool for multi-monitor setups.

Fakefinity captures a selected monitor's display output and re-renders it as a seamless virtual ultrawide mirror across three monitors, skipping user-defined bezel gaps.

## ‚öôÔ∏è INI Configuration (Fakefinity.ini)

```ini
WindowX=-997
WindowY=0
MonitorIndex=1
LeftWidth=1280
CenterWidth=1920
RightWidth=1280
BezelSize=50
VirtualHeight=1080
```

- `WindowX` and `WindowY` set the position of the mirror window.
- `MonitorIndex` is the zero-based index of the monitor to mirror.
- `LeftWidth`, `CenterWidth`, `RightWidth` define monitor widths in pixels.
- `BezelSize` is the pixel gap between displays (horizontal only).
- `VirtualHeight` can override the height if side monitors are taller.
